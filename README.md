# AutoGreen

AutoGreen is a system that automatically applies the GreenWeb language extensions to Web applications to enable QoS-aware energy-efficiency optimizations.

# Overview

AutoGreen works as a browser bookmarklet, which is essentially a piece of JavaScript code that gets injected to the end of a Web application. The following JavaScript code in the textarea is the code that will be injected.  To generate the AutoGreen bookmarklet, drag the <i>AutoGreen</i> link to your bookmarklet bar. To change the injected code, you could simply modify the code in the textarea below and the <i>AutoGreen</i> link will be dynamically updated. Do not forget to drag the <i>AutoGreen</i> link to the bookmarklet bar again after changes are made.

AutoGreen owes a great debt of gratitude to <a href="https://github.com/DataTables/VisualEvent">Visual Events</a>, which automatically identifies details of all JavaScript events associated with all DOM elements on a Web application (webpage).
